## Introduction

Portfolio 1: See - Play - Stay

The purpose of See - Play - Stay was to create a travel website for gamers. In this case we are targetting the city of Berlin. In the last 12 months I have been travelling back and forth to Berlin quite a lot to visit my partner. While I was excited to visit, it was quite overwhelming finding things to do together. Sight-seeing and gaming have been amazing ways to spend quality time together. See - Play - Stay was created with this in mind. A website for gamers to visit and find things to do while visiting the fabulous city of Berlin!
